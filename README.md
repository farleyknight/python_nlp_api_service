# Python NLP API

This project is a way to deal with my perfectionism w.r.t. learning machine learning.

When I try out an ML model, I often get frustrated that it doesn't give perfect results! 

I know logically they cannot, but in spite of this, it frustrates me.

Instead of:

1) Forcing myself to use a model 
2) Get frustrated when it's not perfct
3) Switch it for another model
4) Repeat steps 2-3 until I give up 

## Goal

The goal of this project is to have many NLP tasks behind a common API server.

I may update these over time, but in general I will create a new API endpoint instead of modifying an existing one.

If I do update an existing API, it's to add more options to the API.
